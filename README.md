## :bulb: Motivation and Context
<!--- Optionally point readers to interesting parts of your submission. -->
<!--- What are you especially proud of? -->
Enjoying android development since nearly a year, i'm a big fan of the basic XML UI construction.
I was not really hyped by flutter and/or the whole declarative UI system.
This challenge was the opportunity for me to discover (and especially **love**) this approach !

I Enjoyed nearly every parts of the app creation, but if i had to choose:
* the **LazyColumn** is awesome and simple stupid for me ,
* The navigation component implementation is really cool, despite being the thing i struggled a bit with
